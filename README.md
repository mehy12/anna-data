🌱 Anna-Data

Empowering farmers with fair crop prices and access to agricultural equipment.

Overview

Anna-Data is a two-sided platform designed for farmers and buyers/distributors.
It addresses two primary challenges in Indian agriculture:

Lack of transparent crop pricing.

Limited access to affordable farming equipment.

Built using React, TailwindCSS, and Firebase, the platform provides a clean, minimal, and mobile-first experience.
